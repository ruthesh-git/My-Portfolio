                I’m a software development engineer with a strong foundation in computer science fundamentals and hands-on experience building backend systems and full-stack web applications.<br/><br/>

                I enjoy designing clean APIs, working with databases, and thinking about performance, scalability, and reliability when building software. I focus on writing maintainable code and understanding the trade-offs behind technical decisions.<br/><br/>

                I’ve worked with technologies like Java, Python, Django, React, PostgreSQL, Docker, and AWS, and I actively practice data structures and algorithms to sharpen my problem-solving skills.<br/><br/>
